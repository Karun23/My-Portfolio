            <li><p>During the summer after my A-levels, I took part in a virtual experience with JP Morgan that focused on software engineering. This experience allowed me to gain insight into the day-to-day work of software engineers at one of the world's leading financial institutions. Through a series of online modules, I learned about the different programming languages and tools used in software development, 
             as well as the importance of teamwork and communication in project management. </p></li>
             <li><p>Over the summer, I worked at Sitel as a customer service representative, where I was responsible for taking calls and assisting customers with their inquiries. This experience taught me valuable communication skills, such as how to listen actively, speak clearly, and convey information effectively. In addition, I worked closely with my team members to solve problems 
              and provide solutions to customers, which required us to collaborate and share ideas. It helped me develop my teamwork and problem-solving skills. At times when we didn't know the answer to a customer's question,</p></li>
